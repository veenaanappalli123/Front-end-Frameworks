// Identify which variables should be `const` and which should be `let`. Rewrite the block.

const releaseYear = 2010;
let movieTitle = "Inception";
let isWatched = false;
let rating = 8.8;

// Later in the code:
isWatched = true;
rating = 8.8 + 0.2;
movieTitle = "Interstellar";

console.log(movieTitle, releaseYear, isWatched, rating);
